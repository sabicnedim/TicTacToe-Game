Tic Tac Toe Game on TFT Display with Joystick Control

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game on an embedded system with a TFT display. The game allows two players to take turns placing X and O symbols on a 3x3 grid. A joystick is used to navigate across the grid and select cells. The system highlights the currently selected cell, registers the playerâ€™s move upon confirmation, and automatically detects winning conditions. When a player wins, a line is drawn across the winning combination, and a game over message is displayed. This project demonstrates embedded graphics programming, user interface design, and game logic implementation on microcontrollers.
